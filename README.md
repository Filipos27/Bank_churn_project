# Bank_churn_project
The dataset consists of a randomly sampled population of a banking customers detailing demographics (independent variables) and whether a customer left (or stayed) the bank within the last 6 months (dependent variable). Project goal is to predict whether will customer leave or not.

For this project I used RandomForest classifier and Artificial Neural network.
I also used pandas library,numpy,sckit-learn,imblearn,matplot.
